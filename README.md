## Instructions

This is a simple game that lets you pick two cards which will then be compared. If they match, they will stay face-up, if they do not match, you will lose a point and the cards will return face-down. 
You win the game if all cards are matched and are facing up. You lose the game if you run out of 'stars' or available moves.
If you guess three matches right in a row, you will be rewarded an extra star or move.

## Dependencies

This game is dependent on FontAwesome v4.6.1.
It has no Javascript dependencies. 

## About

This game is a creation through an assignment by Udacity. They provided the layout, the HTML and CSS.
I was tasked with writing out the Javascript. Check it out in `js/app.js`! 
I also had to edit `index.html` and `css/app.css`.

## Contributing

This is forked from the Udacity course, it is a finished assignment.
