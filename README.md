## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

I mainly edited `js/app.js` and added a score screen in `index.html` and `app.css`, because, you know, gotta know when it's ended!
I also added some fun features to the game, like a bonus star if you guess right 3 times in a row!

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).
